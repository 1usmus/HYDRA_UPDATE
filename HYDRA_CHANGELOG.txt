* - Removed all annoying standard MessageBoxes.
* - Removed possibility to load data for the "COMPARE" mode if there are no previous experiments.
* - Resume "HYBRID OC" or "Overriding best cores" after "COMPARE" process is finished (if these functions were enabled before "COMPARE" started).

* - Resume "Overriding best core"s after "BOOST TEST" process is finished (if this function was enabled before the start of "BOOST TEST").

* - Improved feature to disable "Overriding best core" when user runs "DIAGNOSTIC".
* - The timeout time for reading CPPC tags is doubled (5s -> 10s). Should help solve a problem where the tags did not have time to load and threw an exception.
* - Fixed bug related to excessive core load during "CORE CO testing" (the error could have caused the diagnostic operation to be interrupted due to the temperature).
* - The CO curve now has smoother transitions between the offsets and the standard table (should have a positive effect on the stability).
* - Small adjustments to the basic settings.
* - Fixed a glitch where you could activate "HYBRID OC" or "SAVE PROFILES" if the offset table value was incorrect or missing.
* - The protection system will not work if the diagnostic or "HYBRID OC" is not running.
