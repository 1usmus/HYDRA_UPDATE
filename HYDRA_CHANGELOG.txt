* - Improved frequency limitation function for cores relative to the values specified by the user.
* - Redesigned timers for "CUSTOM" profiles. Fixed incorrect operation due to regional OS settings.
* - "HYDRA ASSISTANT" now does not delete the windows log in order to preserve the possibility of alternate reading of CPPC. The disadvantage - "HYDRA ASSISTANT" window every time HYDRA restarts after a crash.
* - Adjustments for profile creation function and automatic generation of maximum allowable frequencies for cores. 
* - Corrected some descriptions.
* ----------------------------------------
* HYDRA 1.1G PRO (1107) - what's new?

* - "AMD PBO2" tab. Added the ability to zero the CO values for each CCD individually.
* - "AMD PBO2" now becomes part of the "HYBRID OC" profiles (I will talk about the future merge in May) therefore backup creation or download functions are now supported.
* - The search for CO values has been significantly refined with the new approach (pdf - guide is attached to the post). Of course, calibrations are planned.
* - Improved diagnostics customization: selection of voltages for testing as well as FFT MAX (previously FFT MAX = FFT MIN).
* - Added 3 presets with diagnostic settings (LIGHT, NORMAL and HEAVY) for users who want ease of use.
* - By default, the user gets the most optimal settings for testing. 1-click concept.
* - If you were using AMD PBO2 but it crashed "HYDRA ASSISTANT" will help you to solve the problem the next time you start the application.
* - Updated "Phoenix" (restore the diagnostic process after a failure) was created to secure diagnostic data. Only available for AMD PBO2 diagnostics. Temporarily.
* - For all types of diagnostics, the "stay awake" function is enabled by default to avoid the screen turning off or the system falling asleep.

* ----------------------------------------
* - Added a loading screen.
* - Added "AMD PBO2" tab to control related functions (Curve Optimizer, EDC,TDC, PPT, FIT, Max CCLK frequency and Tj Max). Cezanne - only Curve Optimizer.
* - Fixed a critical bug where "Overriding best cores" did not restore the original affinity mask for a process (which resulted in a significant drop in performance).
* - C6 state of the cores is switched only when the application is started. Previously, the function did not work at all.
* - Added peak frequency information for "BOOST TEST".
* - Added new MessageBoxe with information about updates and changes.

* - Improved "HYBRID OC". Soft profile switching, calibration and new rules. Positive impact on performance and stability.

* - Once again, the mechanism for activating the game profile has been redesigned. The new mechanism saves precious CPU time, which is so important for performance for profiles that involve all cores.
* - Fixed a bug where Prime95 could not get affinity during diagnostics.
* - Fixed a bug when the application opens in the upper left corner of the screen after damaging "Settings.ini" and "Settings_Backup.ini".

* - Fixed incorrect display of video card name for some systems.
* - Now HYDRA checks if "Settings.ini / Settings_Backup.ini" has the same version (build) as the application itself. If the versions do not match, an automatic reset will be performed. This has a great effect on stability.
* - "Overriding best cores" is able to control two processes at the same time.
* - Changed "Overriding best cores" rules for 5600X (overriding is possible only for 4 cores). The reason is simple - it makes no sense.
* - Fixed system crash when user started "COMPARE" while running "HYBRID OC".
* - Increased stability when using the "AVX1 CO offset" table. New rule for "HYBRID OC" mechanisms: prohibit the use of "AVX1 CO offset" if the load level on one of the cores exceeds the "AVX2 threshold".
* - Adjusting the base "SSE CO offset" values (for MT 50 -> 75).
* - Fixed bug when profiles "CUSTOM#1" and "CUSTOM#2" were not highlighted during work.
* - Changing the AVX operation for the "CORE CO test".
* - Prohibit pressing the "Restoring all settings to their default values" button for modes: "DIAGNOSTIC", "COMPARE", "BOOST TEST".
* - The information MessageBoxes can be moved.

* - Improved stability for the  "Search best voltages".
* - Fixed a bug, where in some cases users saw "CCD#3" in the "Information about the last failure".
* - Fixed a rare bug, where users saw an incomprehensible message in the log before the basic information.
* - "TEMP.ini" files are cleared after the end of the diagnostic process to prevent conflicts with subsequent diagnostics and application of "Phoenix".
* - Some adjustments to the GUI.
* - Optimize application load time (up to -30%).
* ----------------------------------------
* HYDRA 1.1C PRO (1103) - what's new?
* ----------------------------------------
* - Saves the position of the application window at the moment of closing. 
* - New MessageBox.
* - Pause/Resume for "CCD CO test" and "CORE CO test".
* - Added new MessageBoxes for some important operations.
* - Seamless log (during the 1st calendar day all logs will be merged into 1).
* - Added CO SSE offset control (overboost control mechanism for ultralight tasks). Also allow you to get an extra frequency.
* - Added video card information.
* - Fixed bug of incorrectly saving core numbers for "Overriding best cores".
* - Fix infinity loop during diagnostic ( frequency decrease after each unsuccessful attempt).
* - Improved data safety for the "CORE CO test (if the "Phoenix" function is triggered, the data will be duplicated in all 4 ini-files for improved preservation).
* - Removed all annoying standard MessageBoxes.
* - Removed possibility to load data for the "COMPARE" mode if there are no previous experiments.
* - Resume "HYBRID OC" or "Overriding best cores" after "COMPARE" process is finished (if these functions were enabled before "COMPARE" started).
* - Fixed bug when "Overriding best core"s broke "BOOST TEST" results.
* - Resume "Overriding best core"s after "BOOST TEST" process is finished (if this function was enabled before the start of "BOOST TEST").
* - Redesigned function of restoring performance counter settings from system backup storage (possibly fix the bug when the game profile doesn't want to turn on).
* - Improved feature to disable "Overriding best core" when user runs "DIAGNOSTIC".
* - The timeout time for reading CPPC tags is doubled (5s -> 10s). Should help solve a problem where the tags did not have time to load and threw an exception.
* - Fixed bug related to excessive core load during "CORE CO testing" (the error could have caused the diagnostic operation to be interrupted due to the temperature).
* - The CO curve now has smoother transitions between the offsets and the standard table (should have a positive effect on the stability).
* - Small adjustments to the basic settings.
* - Fixed a glitch where you could activate "HYBRID OC" or "SAVE PROFILES" if the offset table value was incorrect or missing.
* - The protection system will not work if the diagnostic or "HYBRID OC" is not running.
* - Removed "RESERVED CO" because this value does not mean correct information. Added simple presets for UEFI CO at the end of diagnostics.
* - Fixed bug with abnormally high "DELTA" after starting "Phoenix".

* - Fixed a bug with huge numbers in cells with core numbers for "Overriding best cores" after "DIAGNOSTIC".
