* ----------------------------------------
* HYDRA 1.1D PRO (1104) - what's new?
* ----------------------------------------
* - Added a loading screen.
* - Added AMD PBO2 tab to control related functions (CO, EDC,TDC, PPT, FIT, Max CCLK frequency and Tj Max). Cezanne - not ready yet.
* - Fixed a critical bug where "Overriding best cores" did not restore the original affinity mask for a process (which resulted in a significant drop in performance).
* - C6 state of the cores is switched only when the application is started. Previously, the function did not work at all.
* - Added peak frequency information for "BOOST TEST".
* - Added new MessageBoxe with information about updates and changes.
* - Timer for "CUSTOM profiles". The user can set the activity time for each profile.
* - Improved "HYBRID OC". Soft profile switching, calibration and new rules. Positive impact on performance and stability.
* - Disabled messages about successful backup of profiles and successful saving of profiles.
* - Once again, the mechanism for activating the game profile has been redesigned. The new mechanism saves precious CPU time, which is so important for performance for profiles that involve all cores.
* - Fixed a bug where Prime95 could not get affinity during diagnostics.
* - Fixed a bug when the application opens in the upper left corner of the screen after damaging "Settings.ini" and "Settings_Backup.ini".
* - Added the ability to adjust cycle time for diagnostics (instead of "Enhance accuracy"). Convenient if you want to make a rough diagnosis by setting the cycle time of 30-60 seconds.
* - Fixed incorrect display of video card name for some systems.
* - Now HYDRA checks if "Settings.ini / Settings_Backup.ini" has the same version (build) as the application itself. If the versions do not match, an automatic reset will be performed. This has a great effect on stability.
* - "Overriding best cores" is able to control two processes at the same time.
* - Changed "Overriding best cores" rules for 5600X (overriding is possible only for 4 cores). The reason is simple - it makes no sense.
* - Fixed system crash when user started "COMPARE" while running "HYBRID OC".
* - Increased stability when using the "AVX1 CO offset" table. New rule for "HYBRID OC" mechanisms: prohibit the use of "AVX1 CO offset" if the load level on one of the cores exceeds the "AVX2 threshold".
* - Adjusting the base SSE CO offset values (for MT 50 -> 75).
* - Fixed bug when profiles "CUSTOM#1" and "CUSTOM#2" were not highlighted during work.
* - Changing the AVX operation for the "CORE CO test".
* - Prohibit pressing the "Restoring all settings to their default values" button for modes: "DIAGNOSTIC", "COMPARE", "BOOST TEST".
* - The information MessageBoxes can be moved.
* - Added button to check for updates.
* - Fixed a bug when it took a long time to create a screenshot.
* - Fixed bug when tests number 2 and 3 did not work during diagnostics.
* - Improved data safety for "CCD CO test".
* - Fixed a rare bug, where "CCD CO tets" could get caught in an endless series of reboots and "Phoenix" runs.
* - Improved stability for the  "Search best voltages".
* - Fixed a bug, where in some cases users saw "CCD#3" in the "Information about the last failure".
* - Fixed a rare bug, where users saw an incomprehensible message in the log before the basic information.
* - "TEMP.ini" files are cleared after the end of the diagnostic process to prevent conflicts with subsequent diagnostics and application of "Phoenix".
* - Some adjustments to the GUI.
* - Optimize application load time (up to -30%).
* ----------------------------------------
* HYDRA 1.1C PRO (1103) - what's new?
* ----------------------------------------
* - Saves the position of the application window at the moment of closing. 
* - New MessageBox.
* - Pause/Resume for "CCD CO test" and "CORE CO test".
* - Added new MessageBoxes for some important operations.
* - Seamless log (during the 1st calendar day all logs will be merged into 1).
* - Added CO SSE offset control (overboost control mechanism for ultralight tasks). Also allow you to get an extra frequency.
* - Added video card information.
* - Fixed bug of incorrectly saving core numbers for "Overriding best cores".
* - Fix infinity loop during diagnostic ( frequency decrease after each unsuccessful attempt).
* - Improved data safety for the "CORE CO test (if the "Phoenix" function is triggered, the data will be duplicated in all 4 ini-files for improved preservation).
* - Removed all annoying standard MessageBoxes.
* - Removed possibility to load data for the "COMPARE" mode if there are no previous experiments.
* - Resume "HYBRID OC" or "Overriding best cores" after "COMPARE" process is finished (if these functions were enabled before "COMPARE" started).
* - Fixed bug when "Overriding best core"s broke "BOOST TEST" results.
* - Resume "Overriding best core"s after "BOOST TEST" process is finished (if this function was enabled before the start of "BOOST TEST").
* - Redesigned function of restoring performance counter settings from system backup storage (possibly fix the bug when the game profile doesn't want to turn on).
* - Improved feature to disable "Overriding best core" when user runs "DIAGNOSTIC".
* - The timeout time for reading CPPC tags is doubled (5s -> 10s). Should help solve a problem where the tags did not have time to load and threw an exception.
* - Fixed bug related to excessive core load during "CORE CO testing" (the error could have caused the diagnostic operation to be interrupted due to the temperature).
* - The CO curve now has smoother transitions between the offsets and the standard table (should have a positive effect on the stability).
* - Small adjustments to the basic settings.
* - Fixed a glitch where you could activate "HYBRID OC" or "SAVE PROFILES" if the offset table value was incorrect or missing.
* - The protection system will not work if the diagnostic or "HYBRID OC" is not running.
* - Removed "RESERVED CO" because this value does not mean correct information. Added simple presets for UEFI CO at the end of diagnostics.
* - Fixed bug with abnormally high "DELTA" after starting "Phoenix".
* - Fixed a bug when interface elements were unlocked too early after pressing the "STOP" button.
* - Fixed a bug with huge numbers in cells with core numbers for "Overriding best cores" after "DIAGNOSTIC".
* - Small optimizations for "Overriding best cores".
* - Added notifications about critical errors during HYDRA startup.
* - "Turn Off PC after diagnostic" now works correctly if "Phoenix" was used.
* - Information about the last failure received additional recommendations (recommendations for interaction with "SSE CO offset").
* - Fixed a bug where checking for updates during disconnected internet would not allow to start HYDRA.
* - Added additional information to the tooltips.
* - Improved check for a new version.
* - Checking permissions for creating and overwriting temporary files.
* - Fixed a bug, that made it impossible to load a previously saved result in "COMPARE" mode.
* - Temporary return of game profile triggers from 1.1A.
